# Purpose of fork
The purpose of this fork is to add to this project functionality similar to https://github.com/eagleflo/jisho. I'm not a rust developer but I have significant experience programming in low level languages and will in all likelihood be able to figure it out. Upon inspection several important QoL fixes have already been done. I'll go ahead an create a release version and a modified PKGBUILD.

# Jisho (cli)
A very simple cli tool to look up Japanese words using jisho.org's API
